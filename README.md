# COM S 5790 ‚Äî Natural Language Processing (Fall 2025)

**Overview:**  
COM S 5790 explores how computers can process, understand, and generate human language. The course introduces both traditional machine learning and modern neural approaches used in NLP, covering topics such as tokenization, language modeling, text classification, transformers, and large language models (LLMs). Through hands-on projects and experiments, students learn to build and evaluate real-world NLP systems for tasks like information extraction, summarization, and question answering, gaining practical experience with tools like Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.
